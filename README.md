## About Google App Engine 

[Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) provides a platform to support web applications that handles the underlying infrastructure so developers can focus on building the applications themselves. The services includes a variety of developer tools, supports many popular languages (e.g. python, java, Node.js, etc.), and allows for seamless scaling.
